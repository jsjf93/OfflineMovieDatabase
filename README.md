# OfflineMovieDatabase

This is a quick Python rework of some old university coursework originally set for c++.
I started learning Python so felt like this would be a gentle introduction.

It reads in two files. One containing a list of movies with various attributes (e.g. title, year, length etc) and ratings with attributes such as timestamp, username, movie title etc.

Maya was used to read the timestamp.
